# Missing Words

My Japanese flashcard app is missing some words. Where'd they go?

- Download the full list from the API
- Find what should be there from the CSV
- Find missing words
- Post 'em.

In Rust, cause why not.

## Where you left off:

Able to fetch all terms from the API. They're in an enum data type, I'm unsure how to use the data, as it seems like an unusual enum.
